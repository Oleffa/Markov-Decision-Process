# Markov Decision Process

This repository contains the matlab code for an implementation of the Markov Decision Process. The project was part of the course "Robotics: Manipulation, Decisionmaking and Learning" at Aalto University.

# Features
The matlab function finde_the_optimal_policy(discount, livingReward, noise) returns the optimal policy as matrix and graphical representation.
It allows to generate custom grids and add/delete obstacles and terminal points and setting their rewards.
